# Salary Calculator

This is my first test project where I created a simple **Salary Calculator** that calculates the total salary based on worked hours. This project is an experiment where I apply my newly acquired programming skills.

## Features
- Calculate salary based on hourly rates.
- Takes into account flexible working hours.
- Easy-to-use interface with basic input/output functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure.
- **JavaScript** for logic (calculation of hours and salary).

## Purpose
This project is a part of my learning process where I experiment with coding and try to implement real-world solutions. The main goal is to deepen my understanding of programming and improve my skills.

Feel free to check it out, and I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement!

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter the number of hours worked and the hourly rate to calculate the salary.
